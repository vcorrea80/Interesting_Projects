## Loading the library for the package installed

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

library(SimDesign)
library(plyr)
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)

## Invstigating DATA Frame

summary(dfb) ## try to give some stats on the data frame
glimpse(dfb) ## gives the structure of the data
head(dfb) ## tibble with a summary of the columns and their DATA Structure Type

## Loading and Merging the DATA

data_all_1 <- list.files(path = "~/Documents/RData_Source/Cyclist-Bike-Share-Data/", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>%
  lapply(read_csv) %>%
  bind_rows

## Creating a Secondary Data Frame for Analysis

dfa <- data_all_1  

## Adding Meaningful Columns to the Data Frame

dfa$year <- strftime(dfa$started_at, "%Y")
dfa$month <- strftime(dfa$started_at, "%Y/%m")
dfa$pickupdate <- strftime(dfa$started_at, "%Y/%m/%d")
dfa$pickuphour <- strftime(dfa$started_at, "%H")
dfa$weekday <- weekdays(dfa$started_at)
dfa$rides <- c(1)
dfa$diff_time <- difftime(dfa$started_at, dfa$ended_at, units="mins")

## Fixing the Order of Weekday in dfa data frame

dfa$weekday <- factor(dfa$weekday, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
factor(dfa$weekday)

## Adding Holidays Table

library(readr)
holidays <- read_csv("Holiday-Data/000001-national-hollidays.csv")

holidays$date2 <- strftime(holidays$date, "%Y/%m/%d") ## to change data type to chr

## Merging dfa with holidays

dfb <- full_join(dfa, holidays, by=c("pickupdate" = "date2"))

dfb$isholiday <- ifelse (is.na(dfb$holiday_name), "no", "yes") ## adding column for indication of holiday

## Creating Analysis Data Frames with Aggregate function

byweekday <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list (dfb$member_casual, dfb$weekday, dfb$isholiday), FUN = sum) ## Member Type by Weekday
bytypebike <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list(dfb$member_casual, dfb$weekday, dfb$rideable_type, dfb$isholiday), FUN = sum) ## Member Type by Weekday by Type of Bike
bymonth <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list (dfb$member_casual, dfb$month, dfb$isholiday), FUN = sum) ## Member Type by Month
byhour <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list (dfb$pickuphour, dfb$isholiday), FUN = sum) ## Rides by Pickup Hour

## Most popular station
poppickstation <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list (dfb$start_station_name), FUN = sum) ## Qtde rides by Pickup Locations
poppickstation <- poppickstation[order(poppickstation$x, decreasing = TRUE) [1:5], ] ## Top 5 Stations for Pickup

poppickstationmember <- aggregate(dfb$rides, by = list (dfb$member_casual, dfb$start_station_name), FUN = sum) ## Qtde rides by Pickup Locations by type of member
